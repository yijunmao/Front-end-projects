# Front-end-projects
pure front-end tiny projects, HTML, CSS, a little bit JS

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:
tiny todo list app with functionalities of displaying, folding, adding, and deleting your todo items.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to play with it:

1. add an item by type in your to-do item in "Add New Todo"
2. check off what you have done by click on the item (you will then see a line through, you can also check on it by clicking again)
3. delete an item by hovering your mouse on the item and then click the "garbage" icon
4. fold the "Add New Todo" by clicking "plus" icon



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Details:

1. CSS styling: linear gradient background, using Google fonts, enable mouse hover effect, using font-awesome

2. JS: jQuery, events (click to switch between check off the to do item with line through, keypress to add a new item)



HAVE FUN :)
